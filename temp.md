Sure, here's an example of test documentation for a web app using Realm Web and Next.js:

# Test Documentation for Web App using Realm Web and Next.js

## Overview

This document outlines the test plan and results for a web app that was built using Realm Web and Next.js. The app allows users to view and manage data from a MongoDB database using a user-friendly web interface.

## Test Plan

The test plan for the web app consists of several types of tests, including:

1. Unit tests: tests on individual functions, components, and modules.
2. Integration tests: tests on how the app integrates with external services, such as MongoDB and Realm Web.
3. User acceptance tests: tests on whether the app meets the user's needs and expectations.

### Unit Tests

The unit tests will be carried out to test the individual functions, components, and modules of the web app. For this, we will use Jest, a popular testing framework for JavaScript applications.

#### User Authentication Module

The user authentication module is responsible for allowing users to login to the app. The functions to be tested include:

1. `login(username: string, password: string)`: this function should authenticate the user using the provided username and password.
2. `logout()`: this function should log the user out of the app.

```markdown
| Test Case # | Test Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Passed |
| -----------| ---------------- | ---------------| -------------| ------ |
| 1 | Test that a user can successfully log in with valid credentials | User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard page | User is authenticated and redirected to the dashboard page | Yes |
| 2 | Test that a user cannot log in with invalid credentials | User is shown an error message indicating invalid username or password | User is shown an error message indicating invalid username or password | Yes |
| 3 | Test that a user can successfully log out | User is logged out and redirected to the login page | User is logged out and redirected to the login page | Yes |
```

#### Dashboard Module

The dashboard module is responsible for displaying data from the MongoDB database. The functions to be tested include:

1. `getData()`: this function should retrieve data from the MongoDB database and format it for display on the dashboard.
2. `sortData(sortBy: string, order: string)`: this function should sort the data displayed on the dashboard by the selected column and in the selected order.

```markdown
| Test Case # | Test Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Passed |
| -----------| ---------------- | ---------------| -------------| ------ |
| 1 | Test that data is correctly retrieved from the MongoDB database | Data is correctly displayed on the dashboard without errors | Data is correctly displayed on the dashboard without errors | Yes |
| 2 | Test that data is correctly sorted by selected column and order | Data is correctly sorted on the dashboard based on selected column and order | Data is correctly sorted on the dashboard based on selected column and order | Yes |
```

### Integration Tests

The integration tests will be carried out to test how the app integrates with external services such as MongoDB and Realm Web. For this, we will use Jest along with MongoDB Memory Server to create a local test environment.

```markdown
| Test Case # | Test Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Passed |
| -----------| ---------------- | ---------------| -------------| ------ |
| 1 | Test that connection with MongoDB is established without errors | App can connect to MongoDB without errors | App can connect to MongoDB without errors | Yes |
| 2 | Test that data is correctly written to the MongoDB database | Data is correctly written to the database without errors | Data is correctly written to the database without errors | Yes |
| 3 | Test that data is correctly read from the MongoDB database | Data is correctly read from the database without errors | Data is correctly read from the database without errors | Yes |
| 4 | Test that connection with Realm Web is established without errors | App can connect to Realm Web without errors | App can connect to Realm Web without errors | Yes |
```

### User Acceptance Tests

The user acceptance tests will be carried out to test whether the app meets the user's needs and expectations. We will perform these tests using manual testing strategies and user surveys.

```markdown
| Test Case # | Test Description | Expected Result | Actual Result | Passed |
| -----------| ---------------- | ---------------| -------------| ------ |
| 1 | Test that the app's user interface is user-friendly and intuitive for users | Users are able to navigate through the app and carry out their desired tasks without difficulties | Users are able to navigate through the app and carry out their desired tasks without difficulties | Yes |
| 2 | Test that the app meets the user's needs and expectations | User surveys indicate that the app meets the user's needs and expectations | User surveys indicate that the app meets the user's needs and expectations | Yes |
```

## Test Results

Based on the test plan outlined above, the test results are as follows:

- All unit tests passed without errors.
- All integration tests passed without errors.
- User acceptance tests indicated that the app's user interface is user-friendly and meets the user's needs and expectations.

Overall, the web app was test
